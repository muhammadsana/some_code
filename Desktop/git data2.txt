 Clone a Projectï»¿ The Clone project action lets you create a project that is similar
 but not identical to an existing project.
 This operation lets you create new projects without having to configure
 them from scratch. Once you create the new project,
 you can modify its settings independently from
 the original project.

The git log graph command creates a graphic overview of how a 
various development pipelines have branched and merged over time.

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without 
affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose
changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting
point for your own idea.

What are some common reasons to fork a git project?
To fix an issue outside of the main project with the intent to have it merged 
into the original project later.
To use a fork as a basis for a new project.

pull requests are designed to be initiated by the GIT CLIENT and completed
by the REPOSITORY ADMINISTRATOR.

git remote -v will show you the remote repository that you are tracking, along with its URL(s).

git pull will download changes from a remote repository and attempt to merge them into the local repository.

What is the difference between GitLab and GitHub?
The major difference between GitHub and GitLab is the platform each philosophy presents.
GitHub has higher availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance, 
while GitLab is more focused on offering a features-based system with a centralized,
integrated platform for web developers.
